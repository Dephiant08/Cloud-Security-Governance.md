# Cloud Security Architecture Best Practices

A well-designed cloud security architecture is essential to protect data and applications hosted in the cloud. This guide outlines key principles for securing your cloud infrastructure.

## 1. **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**:
    - Implement least privilege access policies using role-based access control (RBAC).
    - Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all critical accounts.
    
## 2. **Encryption and Data Protection**:
    - Encrypt data both at rest and in transit using industry standards (AES-256, TLS 1.2+).
    - Regularly rotate encryption keys and utilize a centralized key management system (KMS).

## 3. **Network Security**:
    - Use network segmentation and virtual private clouds (VPCs) to isolate sensitive workloads.
    - Deploy Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and security groups to restrict unauthorized access.

## 4. **Monitoring and Incident Response**:
    - Enable real-time monitoring of cloud resources using AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, or Google Cloud Operations.
    - Develop and test a cloud-specific incident response plan to address security breaches.

## Tools and Platforms:
- AWS CloudFormation, Azure Security Center, Google Cloud Armor
